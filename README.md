a. Description of the project

This project is a simple survey that for business analytics students. This survey is short but asks them for personal information, and then stuff about the analytics major.

b. How your web form conforms to best practices for forms?

My web form follows key best practices to ensures usability for users. First, I implemented proper labeling for form fields using label elements. This ensures compatibility with screen readers, improving accessibility for users with disabilities. Thus making it easier to use and understand this survey as a whole.

Second, my form incorporates required field validation and input constraints to guide users in entering correct information. Also, my form is structured with clear spacing, logical grouping, and a responsive design to enhance readability and user experience across different devices.

2b. What specifically did you do on your assignment that is a best practice for forms?

One key improvement was proper form labeling. I ensured that forms had correct label elements. This helps screen readers identify the purpose of each field, improving accessibility for users with disabilities.

c. How your form provides for user accessibility

I include title attributes and icons to provide additional context for users who need clarification. I had autofocus to make sure users would know where to start. Along with a drop downlist that was WCAG approved which is accessible to everyone. Lastly, I had buttons that allowed to go to the next page that was clearly laid out.

2d. What specifically did you do to make your web forms accessible to all users?

I changed the hometown and country boxes to be labels elements rather than a normal box to write in. This made it easier for users to understand and use.
